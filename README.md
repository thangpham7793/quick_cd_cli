### Quick CD CLI in Golang

A simple CLI to CRUD aliases of dirs and cd into them using the aliases

*no longer working on this since <strong>cd</strong> is a builtin shell process and couldn't find a way to execute the program in the current shell rather than as an external process.* 

*A work around would be to add aliases to user's .bashrc, but that is high-risk, hacky (probably involving some string building) and reinventing the built-in <strong>alias</strong> and <strong>source</strong> bash cmds.* 

*Still, learned a lot about linux bash and BDD in go.*
